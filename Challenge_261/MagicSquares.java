/*
Description:
A 3x3 magic square is a 3x3 grid of the numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and major diagonal adds up to 15. Here's an example:
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
The major diagonals in this example are 8 + 5 + 2 and 6 + 5 + 4. (Magic squares have appeared here on r/dailyprogrammer before, in 
#65 [Difficult] in 2012.)
Write a function that, given a grid containing the numbers 1-9, determines whether it's a magic square. Use whatever format you want 
for the grid, such as a 2-dimensional array, or a 1-dimensional array of length 9, or a function that takes 9 arguments. You do not 
need to parse the grid from the program's input, but you can if you want to. You don't need to check that each of the 9 numbers appears 
in the grid: assume this to be true.
